# Splatoon3 Data Analysis (and Potential Website App)
There are two main goals for this project:
1. Analyze Splatoon gameplay data and develop predictive models to predict possibility of winning\
2. Develop a webpage that employees the ML model

## 1. Acquire Battle Data 
Thanks to [s3s](https://github.com/frozenpandaman/s3s), I was able to upload my Splatoon 3 battle data from the SplatNet 3 servic to [stat.ink](https://stat.ink/@umikome). The data can be exported as json files.
